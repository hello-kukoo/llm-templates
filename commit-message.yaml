  Write a concise, informative commit message for these changes:

  - Review the whole context of the diff carefully to see what effect the change would have on the rest of the code and explain that. Be specific about the effect.
  - Do not guess about intent.
  - The goal of this commit message is that someone familiar with the codebase, but not with these changes would understand why the changes were made and what was changed.
  - The first line should be a short summary of the intent of the changes
  - Remember to mention the files that were changed, and what was changed
  - Keep the summary under 50 characters
  - Use bullet points for multiple changes
  - Reference related issues or tickets, but only if you are 100% sure the ticket numbers are correct.
  - If the change is just to documentation, state that.
  - If there are no changes, or the input is blank - then return a blank string

  Think carefully about what would be most helpful to someone trying to understand the intent of this commit before you write your commit message. Your commit message will be used as an example to train other team members about the content of a good commit message.

  Think in English but write in Chinese.

  What you write will be passed to git commit -m "[message]"

  The output format should be:

  Summary of changes\n
  \n
  - change\n
  - change\n
  ..and so on.
